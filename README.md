# Sample Hardhat NFT Project


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample ERC721A contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Rename `example.env` to `.env` and update values. 

Install dependencies: `npm install`

Compile: `npx hardhat compile`

Run Tests: `npx hardhat test`

Deploy to testnet: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia`

Verify contract `npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <address>`

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
